Installation instructions
-------------------------

Firstly, please forgive me - I have no idea how to use autotools at the moment, I'll try that in the future.
If you plan to install the game globally (i.e. in /usr/local/games) then you need do nothing to the Makefile
just type:
make
make install
If you just want to play from the current directory then edit the Makefile and remove the # from the start
of the line that reads "DATA_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/games/hhh" and put a # in front of the line that reads
"DATA_INSTALL_DIR=."
Then do
make

To run the game:
./hhh or hhh if you installed globally. Space to start.

To remove all the object files do:
make clean
to remove everything (all source code *.o, *.cc and *.h files) do:
make megaclean
(You will not be able to type 'make' again to recompile if you do this)

If you've chosen to install globally, you can now delete the whole source directory.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer and SDL_ttf installed and their appropriate devel packages
and you will also need g++ (part of the Gnu Compiler Collection). I don't know if this compiles on 
windows as I don't have windows to test it on. The file Makefile.win32 may make a windows exe file,
it may not, and even if it does it may not work. Windows is secondary to me.
